With [Scale Functions](https://scale.sh) your users can write fully typed plugins in any language they choose, and your application can easily and safely
run those plugins with the Scale Runtime, which provides state-of-the-art sandboxing, low startup times, and extremely high performance.

Currently, guest plugins can be written in [Golang](https://golang.org), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), with the Runtime supporting [Golang](https://golang.org) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) host applications.

## Getting Started

First, install the [CLI](https://scale.sh/docs/getting-started/quick-start#install-the-scale-cli).

Create a new function, passing `<name>:<tag>` to the `new` command:

```bash
scale new hello:1.0
```

The following files will be generated:

```yaml
version: v1alpha
name: hello
tag: 1.0
signature: http@v0.3.4
language: go
dependencies:
- name: github.com/loopholelabs/scale-signature
version: v0.2.9
- name: github.com/loopholelabs/scale-signature-http
version: v0.3.4
source: scale.go
```

```Go
//go:build tinygo || js || wasm
package scale

import (
    signature "github.com/loopholelabs/scale-signature-http"
)

func Scale(ctx *signature.Context) (*signature.Context, error) {
    ctx.Response().SetBody("Hello, World!")
    return ctx.Next()
}
```

```Go
module scale

go 1.18

require github.com/loopholelabs/scale-signature v0.2.9
require github.com/loopholelabs/scale-signature-http v0.3.4
```

For more information on these files, see the full [Quick Start Guide](https://scale.sh/docs/getting-started/quick-start#create-a-new-function).

Build the above function:

```bash
scale function build
```
And run:

```bash
scale run local/hello:1.0
```

This will start a local HTTP server on port `8080` and will run the function whenever you make a request to it.

Et VoilÃ ! Your first Scale Function! ðŸŽ‰

----

Functions be [chained together](https://scale.sh/docs/languages/golang/overview#guest-support), [embedded in other language's apps](https://scale.sh/docs/languages/javascript-typescript/overview#embedding-scale-functions), and used independently. For more information, as well as usage with other supported
language, including Rust and TypeScript/JavaScript, see the [documentation](https://scale.sh/docs).
